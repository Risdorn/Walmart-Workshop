# Walmart Workshop

The workshop taught the basics of Time Series Forecasting and a few advanced topics form Supply Chain Optimization and Computer Vision.

## Time Series Forecasting

Learned the basics of Time Series Forecasting, including a few basic models. Also used the models on Store Sales data.

## Supply Chain Optimization

Learned about different Probabilistic models such as Simulated Annealing, which was used in finding optimal routes(modified version of Travelling Salesman Problem). 

Problem: Letâ€™s say we have a depot/hub of an eCommerce organisation (like Walmart) and packages (customer orders) must be delivered from the depot/hub to
customer locations. Let's say we have a limit on number of orders a vehicle can deliver (Vehicle Capacity) . In that case we need to use
multiple vehicles to deliver all the orders.

Also learned about 3D Bin Packing Problem.

## Computer Vision

Learned about transformers and how they are being used in object detection.

# Walmart Workshop

Round 1 consisted of 2 problems, the first was a standard Travelling Salesman Problem and the second was the same as the problem taught in Supply Chain Optimization workshop.

Round 2 details can be found [here](https://github.com/Risdorn/Predicting-Drive-Failure), We were tasked with trying out different models for Predicting Hard Drive Failures.
